-- SOA fixes:
-- 1. Invoice ledger events use issue_date (not became_outstanding_at) when set.
-- 2. Ledger balance and rows are computed over visible events only: a wallet
--    top-up is credited once when received, so wallet-paid invoices must not
--    add a second credit (that double-counts the same money and makes the
--    running balance jump upward between visible debits).
-- 3. Open-invoice RPC uses invoice_settled_amount, not raw amount_paid.
